# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is the sixth weeks homework assignment. The challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The acceptance criteria for the project were as follows:
- When the weather dashboard is opened you are presented with a form input
- When a city is searched you are presented with current and future conditions.
- That city is then added to a search history list.
- Each city searched should display the city name, the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
- The UV index should present a color that indicates if the condition are favorable, moderate, or severe.
- A 5-Day forease should display the date, an icon represention of the weather conditions, temperature, and humidity.
- When a search history city in the list is clicked, your should recieve updated weather conditions for that particular city.

I found this homework assignment to be the most challenging to date. I was able to use many things I have learned over the course of the bootcamp. In the project I used bootstrap and JQuery mostly. I really enjoy using bootstrap and feel my JQuery skills have really improved from the previous asignment. 

This project was a real challenge to me, I feel I have completed most of the task. I still do not have the search history buttons working correctly. I will be meeting with my tutor soon to hopefully get some guidance on how to get that working properly. Even though everything is not working properly with regards to the search history button, I feel very proud of how the rest of the weather dashboard works.
